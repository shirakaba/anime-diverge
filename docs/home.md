## What is Anime Diverge?

Anime Diverge is a manually-curated website that collects into one place all the recommendations of what content to read after reaching the end of an anime series.

Normally this information is scattered across blog posts and Reddit threads. Even if it's a manual effort (and it is – this is a hand-curated website with no smarts), I'd like to compile all the information into one place.

## What's your motivation for collecting this data?

First off, I simply like organising disorganised data. For example, I once [compiled every prompt](https://twitter.com/LinguaBrowse/status/1309430406110994432?s=20) given throughout series 1-7 of the TV panel show *Would I Lie to You*?

But – full disclosure – as a bonus carrot, I thought I'd try adding Amazon affiliate links so that one can easily purchase any volumes mentioned on this site and see whether it goes anywhere.

## How dare you profit off our readership!

If this ever translates into me getting a yacht, I'll let you all know.

To be honest, if it goes nowhere, I'll just open-source the website and crowd-source all the research instead.

## Are contributions accepted?

Absolutely! Provided you're cool with me placing affiliate links.

I'll create a GitHub issues page where one can submit info for shows, and translate them into web pages myself.
