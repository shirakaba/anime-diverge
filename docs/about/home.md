## What is Anime Diverge?

Anime Diverge is a manually-curated website that collects into one place all the recommendations of what content to read after reaching the end of an anime series.

Normally this information is scattered across blog posts and Reddit threads. Even if it's a manual effort (and it is – this is a hand-curated website with no smarts), I'd like to compile all that information into one place.

## What's your motivation for collecting this data?

For one thing, I simply like organising disorganised data. For example, I once [compiled every prompt](https://twitter.com/LinguaBrowse/status/1309430406110994432?s=20) given throughout series 1-7 of the TV panel show *Would I Lie to You*?

And for another thing, I am always on the lookout for manga (and sometimes light novels or web novels) to pick up; but often I've already seen the anime for the given franchise, so I'm not sure where to continue.

### You don't earn money from those Amazon links?

No (they're regular Amazon links, not Amazon Affiliate links). I decided I'd rather make a large open-source project aided by the power of crowdsourcing than a small solo project that funded a coffee every now and then.

The Amazon links still have a purpose – to help people find the right product (I've often bought the light novel instead of the manga by accident) and understand how many volumes are available in a series. Even though I'm not based in the US, I've chosen Amazon US as the standard – I'm not quite sure how to solve product links for other regions except by lots more manual effort.

## Are contributions accepted?

Absolutely! Just make sure to match the format of existing pages and, in particular, provide citations as I have done. Even then, I'm a bit particular about the formatting, so may make some tweaks even if the contribution is generally sound.
