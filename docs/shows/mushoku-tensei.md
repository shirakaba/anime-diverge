Where does the **Mushoku Tensei** anime leave off?

The anime has two series aired so far:

* Series 1: 11 episodes, aired 11th Jan 2021 -> 22nd March 2021
* Series 2: 12 episodes, airing 4th Oct 2021 -> present

## Light novel

Series 1 of the anime covers **volumes 1-3** of the light novel[[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mushokutensei/comments/mrh3fa/where_does_the_anime_leave_off_in_the_light_novel/gum8tv2/).

Between series 1 and 2 of the anime, there is apparently a light novel chapter "the princess of Asura and the angel" which was omitted from the anime[[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mushokutensei/comments/mrh3fa/where_does_the_anime_leave_off_in_the_light_novel/gum8tv2/).

Series 2 of the anime, which is currently airing, resumes from **volume 4** of the light novel[[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mushokutensei/comments/mrh3fa/where_does_the_anime_leave_off_in_the_light_novel/gum8tv2/).

* Read volume 4 in English: [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/Mushoku-Tensei-Jobless-Reincarnation-Light-ebook/dp/B07W4FZWDL)
* Read all volumes in English: [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083BZSQ85)

## Manga

*Warning: there is a common sentiment that the manga is a bad adaptation, skipping out much of the contents of the Light Novel.*

Series 1 of the anime covers chapters 1-26 of the manga (i.e. **volumes 1-3**)[[2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mushokutensei/comments/mat5xq/where_does_the_anime_leave_off_in_the_manga/)[[3]](https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/ma5bkr/what_chapter_of_the_manga_does_the_anime_version/grqkftk/), specifically ending midway through chapter 26.

Series 2 of the anime, which is currently airing, I presume covers **volume 4** onward.

* Read volume 4 in English: [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/Mushoku-Tensei-Jobless-Reincarnation-Vol/dp/1626923426)
* Read all volumes in English: [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JJNK8L8)

## Web novel

Series 1 of the anime covers **volumes 1-3** of the web novel (based on these volumes corresponding one-to-one [according to Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mushoku_Tensei_volumes#Light_novel)).

Series 2 of the anime, which is currently airing, should therefore resume from **volume 4** of the web novel by the same logic.

* Read chapter 34 (the first chapter of volume 4) in Japanese: [小説家になろう](https://ncode.syosetu.com/n9669bk/38/)
