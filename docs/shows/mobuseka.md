# MobuSeka

Where does the **MobuSeka** manga leave off?

There is no anime series yet, but maybe you'd like to continue on from the manga.

## Light novel

There are 3 volumes of the light novel released in English (9 in Japanese) at the time of writing.

Here is how the volumes line up[[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobuSeka/comments/jr5xkc/mobuseka_faqmegathread/):

* Volume 1 of the manga covers light novel Volume 1 Chapters 1-5
* Volume 2 of the manga covers light novel Volume 1 Chapters 5-10
* Volume 3 of the manga covers light novel Volume 1 Chapter 10 to Volume 2 Chapter 1
* Volume 4 of the manga covers light novel Volume 2 Chapters 2-4
* Volume 5 of the manga covers light novel Volume 2 Chapters 4-7
* Volume 6 of the manga covers light novel Volume 2 Chapters 7-10

* Read volume 3 in English: [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B095N2P41J)
* Read all volumes in English: [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NQ2X8X2)

## Manga

There are 2 volumes of the manga released in English (6 in Japanese) at the time of writing.

See the bullet points above for which chapters of the manga are covered by which chapters of the light novel.

* Read volume 2 in English: [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/Trapped-Dating-Sim-World-Otome-ebook/dp/B09CKB93N8)
* Read all volumes in English: [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0969QBPVC)

## Web novel

I'm not clear how the web novel lines up with the light novel, but I can see one of the last chapters in part two, [黒騎士](https://ncode.syosetu.com/n3191eh/25/) corresponds with the same-named upcoming instalment of the manga: volume 7, chapter 36.

So **volumes 1-7 of the manga broadly cover parts 1-2 of the web novel**.

* Read part 3, chapter 1 in Japanese: [小説家になろう](https://ncode.syosetu.com/n3191eh/29/)
* Read all chapters in Japanese: [小説家になろう](https://ncode.syosetu.com/n3191eh/)
