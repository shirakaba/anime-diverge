I'm missing a lot of the information needed to fill in the rest of this table, so any help would be appreciated!

## Manga

* Read all volumes in English: [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JJHWDJH)

## Web novel

Although it was originally available on 小説家になろう under the URL `https://ncode.syosetu.com/n5393ba/`. It appears that it has been unpublished since then, however, and I can't find an archive of it.
