# KonoSuba

Where does the **KonoSuba** anime leave off?

The anime has two series aired so far:

* Series 1: 10 episodes, aired 13th Jan 2016 -> 16th March 2016
* Series 2: 10 episodes, aired 12th Jan 2017 -> 16th March 2017
* Series 3: still only a rumour!

There are also two OVA episodes that followed soon after each series ended, and two movies.

## Light novel

Series 1 of the anime broadly covers **volumes 1-2** of the light novel[[1]](https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/42909/which-ln-volumes-are-covered-in-season-12-of-konosuba-anime), with some of the contents of volume 2 delegated to series 2 episode 3 instead.

Series 2 of the anime broadly covers **volumes 3-4** of the light novel[[1]](https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/42909/which-ln-volumes-are-covered-in-season-12-of-konosuba-anime), though as mentioned, episode 3 covers some of volume 2.

## Web novel

The web novel has been removed from publication, but various chapters are still available through the internet wayback machine. There are presumably unofficial translation groups who picked up the web novel while it was still available.

I'm not clear how the anime lines up with the web novel, as there's not much information out there about it in contrast to the light novel. Its 124 chapters are, however, formatted as five parts, just like the light novel, so at least the parts may broadly correspond.
