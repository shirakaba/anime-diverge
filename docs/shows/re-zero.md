# Re:Zero

Where does the **Re:Zero** anime leave off?

The anime has two series and some OVAs:

* Series 1: 25 episodes, aired 4th Apr 2016 -> 19th Sep 2016
* Series 2: 25 episodes, aired 8th Jul 2020 -> 24th Mar 2021
* OVA: 2 episodes ("Memory Snow" and "The Frozen Bond"), aired 6th Oct 2018 -> 8th Nov 2019

I will not cover what the OVAs adapt, as it's a bit complicated; see the "other info" section for more details on those.

## Light novel

There are 17 volumes of the light novel released in English at the time of writing.

Series 1 of the anime covers arcs 1-3, i.e. **volumes 1-9** of the light novel (assuming it covers every volume leading up to series 2, which I do have citations for).

Series 2 of the anime covers arc 4, i.e. **volumes 10-15** of the light novel[[1]](https://rezero.fandom.com/wiki/Arc_4?commentId=4400000000000028240&replyId=4400000000000079916)[[2]](https://rezero.fandom.com/f/p/4400000000000037089/r/4400000000000131422).

## Manga

The main manga is divided into "chapters" (which I believe correspond to the novel arcs); in total, 19 volumes have been released in English at the time of writing:

* Chapter 1 has 2 volumes;
* Chapter 2 has 5 volumes;
* Chapter 3 has 11 volumes;
* Chapter 4 has 1 volume (so far).

Series 1 of the anime covers **Chapter 1, volume 1, to Chapter 3, volume 10** of the manga (source: they have the same titles).

Series 2 of the anime covers **all of the remaining manga released so far, i.e. Chapter 3, volume 11, to Chapter 4, volume 1** by episode 3 (source: they have the same titles).
