* Series 2: 12 episodes, aired 5th Apr 2020 -> 21st Jun 2020
* Series 3: ? episodes, airing Spring 2022

## Light novel

The light novel is divided into "parts", with the numbering for the volumes resetting after each part. To help match up with the anime, first we need to understand the light novel numbering.

* Part 1 of the light novel has 3 volumes.
* Part 2 of the light novel has 4 volumes.
* Part 3 of the light novel has 5 volumes.
* Part 4 of the light novel has 4 volumes (at least so far).

Series 1 of the anime covers all of Part 1 of the light novel; i.e. **Part 1 volumes 1-3** of the light novel[[1]](https://anilist.co/forum/thread/28720/comment/779352).

Series 2 of the anime covers some of Part 2 of the light novel; **Part 2 volumes 1-2** of the light novel[[2]](https://anilist.co/anime/113693/Honzuki-no-Gekokujou-Shisho-ni-Naru-Tame-ni-wa-Shudan-wo-Erandeiraremasen-2/).

Series 3 of the anime will cover the rest of Part 2 of the light novel; **Part 2 volumes 3-4** of the light novel[[3]](https://anilist.co/anime/121176/Honzuki-no-Gekokujou-Shisho-ni-Naru-Tame-ni-wa-Shudan-wo-Erandeiraremasen-3/).

* Read all volumes in English: [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/Ascendance-Bookworm-10-Book/dp/B08RYY44GB)

## Manga

The manga adapts the light novel faithfully, and so is also divided up into the same "parts" (thus we can re-use what we know about the light novel coverage to work out the manga coverage):

* Part 1 of the manga has 7 volumes[[4]](https://anilist.co/manga/96775/Honzuki-no-Gekokujou-Shisho-ni-Naru-Tame-ni-wa-Shudan-wo-Erandeiraremasen-Dai-1bu--Hon-ga-Nai-nara-Tsukureba-Ii/).
* Part 2 of the manga has 3 volumes (at least so far).

Series 1 of the anime covers all of Part 1 of the manga; i.e. **Part 1 volumes 1-7** of the manga.

Series 2 of the anime covers some of Part 2 of the manga; i.e. **Part 2 volumes 1-2** of the manga.

Series 3 of the anime will cover the rest of Part 2 of the manga; i.e. **Part 2 volume 3, and all remaining volumes in Part 2** of the manga.

* Read Part 2 volume 3 in English: [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/Ascendance-Bookworm-Manga-Part-Kazuki-ebook/dp/B09HCJC48P)

## Web novel
