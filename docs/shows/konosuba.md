Where does the **KonoSuba** anime leave off?

The anime has two series aired so far:

* Series 1: 10 episodes, aired 13th Jan 2016 -> 16th March 2016
* OVA 1: "God's Blessings on This Wonderful Choker!", released Jun 24th, 2016
* Series 2: 10 episodes, aired 12th Jan 2017 -> 16th March 2017
* OVA 2: "God's Blessings on This Wonderful Work Of Art!", released Jul 24th, 2017
* Movie: "Legend of Crimson", released Aug 30th, 2019
* Series 3: still only a rumour!

There are also two OVA episodes that followed soon after each series ended, and two movies.

## Light novel

Series 1 of the anime broadly covers **volumes 1-2** of the light novel[[1]](https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/42909/which-ln-volumes-are-covered-in-season-12-of-konosuba-anime), with some of the contents of volume 2 delegated to series 2 episode 3 instead.

Series 2 of the anime broadly covers **volumes 3-4** of the light novel[[1]](https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/42909/which-ln-volumes-are-covered-in-season-12-of-konosuba-anime), though as mentioned, episode 3 covers some of volume 2.

I believe the OVAs are original anime-only stories that are not based on any web novel or light novel contents.

## Web novel

The web novel consists of 113 chapters (124 if you include short stories[[3]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Konosuba/comments/5q6595/wn_spoilers_can_anyone_who_has_read_the_wn_give/dcx0qn4/)), formatted as five parts.

The web novel has been removed from publication, but various chapters are still available (in Japanese) through the internet wayback machine.

The light novel diverged from the web novel in volume 6, and it's clear that some events happen out of order[[4]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Konosuba/comments/5q6595/wn_spoilers_can_anyone_who_has_read_the_wn_give/dcx32w2/).

It is said that the order of the plot in the web novel is sufficiently different that you can't read it as a continuation of season 2 of the anime[[5]](https://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q13171801923), with examples of differences given[[6]](https://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q10208617655).

My impression from reading the Yahoo user groups comments was that the light novel had surpassed the web novel both in length and in plot covered, so it would be best to just read that instead!
